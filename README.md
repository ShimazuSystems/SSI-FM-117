## SSI-FM-117

Current Notes of Importance
- Where this states 'Scores' or 'Systems' this is implied to mean 'Create/Use your Own'.
- I have explicitly stated this throughout
- This document will likely be out of date by the time you read it
- This document is for my organisation, which isn't formally incorporated. Additionally, these cited references are not covered in this documentation and are referring to internal documents you can't see (sorry)

I am not responsible for your actions, or the consequences of your actions. Yes this seems overkill, but I need this system to be able to scale. This current version is the first draft, it should be taken as a template and changed based on scenarios.

To enable this, I have written this to be exactly how an LLM would write/output, this document is just as much made to be parseable to AI systems as it is a person.

Each handwritten section has been rewritten using Claude 4 Opus to ensure that my own Bias (and somewhat poor use of punctuation) doesn't leak through.

I have provided Sources, but a significant part of this is the Claude 4 System Card. You will have to manually find where I'm getting statistics from (Claude failed to check its own System Card for this data and persistently claimed it as fictional).

I hope somebody with the correct qualifications/certifications makes a better version - this shouldn't be left to the User to figure out whilst companies like Anthropic frolick in a hedonistic idea of what 'AI' should be.
